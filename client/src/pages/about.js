        Building Vermont is dedicated to the identification, documentation and
        preservation of architecture throughout Vermont. I began
        researching Vermont's architecture in 2004, as a graduate
        student in the Historic Preservation Graduate Program at the University
        of Vermont. My master's thesis documented modernist residential design
        in Chittenden County, VT, and I continue to seek out buildings
        throughout the state and gather information on the architects who
        designed them.

        The goal of Building Vermont is to make all of the
        information I have collected over the years available to students,
        researchers and the general public. Ideally, this information will raise
        awareness of Vermont's architectural resources and help
        preserve these buildings for future generations to appreciate.
