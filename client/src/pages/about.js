      <div>Vermont Modern is dedicated to the identification, documentation and preservation of modernist architecture throughout Vermont. I began researching Vermont's modernist architecture in 2004, as a graduate student in the Historic Preservation Graduate Program at the University of Vermont. My master's thesis documented modernist residential design in Chittenden County, VT, and I continue to seek out modernist buildings throughout the state and gather information on the architects who designed them.

The goal of Vermont Modern is to make all of the information I have collected over the years available to students, researchers and the general public. Ideally, this information will raise awareness of Vermont's modernist architectural resources and help preserve these buildings for future generations to appreciate.

Thanks for your interest, and please feel free to contact me with any comments or questions!
